      `I'm in the world of technology since I was a kid when my father bought our very first computer. I was introduced to programming at 12 when I used Blender to create a game even that at that moment I didn't know that it was called programming.`,
      `At 14 I started my technology high school entering in Computer Engineering graduation after that. Since then I've been working on a vast variety of projects from games, mobile and desktop applications to robots!`,
      `I'm currently studying and improving my data science skills for my graduation thesis.`,
